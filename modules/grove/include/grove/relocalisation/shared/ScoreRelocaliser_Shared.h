/**
 * \brief Merges the SCoRe predictions associated with the specified keypoint into a single SCoRe prediction.
 *
 * \note  Each keypoint will have a SCoRe prediction (set of clusters) from each tree in the forest, obtained by passing
 *        the keypoint's descriptor down each tree and collecting a SCoRe prediction from each resulting leaf.
 * \note  Merging is performed by taking the largest clusters from each leaf. The assumption is that the modal cluters in
 *        each leaf are already sorted in non-increasing order of size.
 *
 * \param x                 The x coordinate of the keypoint.
 * \param y                 The y coordinate of the keypoint.
 * \param predictionsBlock  A pointer to the storage area holding all of the SCoRe predictions associated with the forest leaves.
 * \param leafIndices       A pointer to the image containing the indices of the leaves (in the different trees) associated with each keypoint/descriptor pair.
 * \param outputPredictions A pointer to the image into which to store the merged SCoRe predictions.
 * \param imgSize           The dimensions of the leafIndices and outputPredictions images.
 * \param nbMaxPredictions  The maximum number of predictions to merge for each output prediction.

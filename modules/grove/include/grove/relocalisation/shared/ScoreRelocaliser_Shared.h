 * \brief Merges the SCoRe predictions associated with multiple leaves into a single SCoRe prediction.
 *
 * \note  Merging is performed by taking the largest clusters from each leaf. The assumption is that
 *        the modal cluters in each leaf are already sorted in non-increasing order of size.
 *
 * \param leafPredictions  A pointer to the storage area holding all the ScorePredictions associated to forest leaves.
 * \param leafIndices      A pointer to the storage area where the leaf indices for the current example are stored.
 * \param outPredictions   A pointer to the storage area that will hold the final merged prediction.
 * \param imgSize          The dimensions of the leafIndices and outPredictions arrays.
 * \param nbMaxPredictions The maximum number of predictions to merge for each output prediction.
 * \param x                The x coordinate of the leaves to process.
 * \param y                The y coordinate of the leaves to process.

# SemanticPaint: A Framework for Interactive, Real-Time 3D Scene Segmentation

![teaser](teaser.png)

*Project page:* [http://www.semantic-paint.com](http://www.semantic-paint.com)

This is an open-source, real-time implementation of the interactive *SemanticPaint* system for geometric reconstruction, object-class segmentation and learning of 3D scenes, originally published in [Valentin15]. Using our system, a user can walk into a room wearing a depth camera and a virtual reality headset, and both densely reconstruct the 3D scene [Newcombe11,Niessner13,Kaehler15] and interactively segment the environment into object classes such as 'chair', 'floor' and 'table'. The user interacts *physically* with the real-world scene, touching objects and using voice commands to assign them appropriate labels. These user-generated labels are leveraged by an online random forest-based machine learning algorithm, which is used to predict labels for previously unseen parts of the scene. The entire pipeline runs in real time, and the user stays 'in the loop' throughout the process, receiving immediate feedback about the progress of the labelling and interacting with the scene as necessary to refine the predicted segmentation.

This version of the *SemanticPaint* concept was implemented by [Stuart Golodetz](http://research.gxstudios.net) and [Michael Sapienza](http://sites.google.com/site/mikesapi), under the supervision of [Professor Philip Torr](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg). More recently, it has been significantly extended by Tommaso Cavallari, Stuart Golodetz and Nick Lord, with the most significant change being the addition of our [Grove relocaliser](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/projects/RFAdaptation/index.php), as described in [Cavallari17].

Our framework is built on top of [InfiniTAM v3.5](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~victor/infinitam/index.html), a highly efficient, open-source 3D reconstruction engine developed by Oxford's [Active Vision Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/OxVisionLib). Anyone interested in InfiniTAM should contact [Victor Adrian Prisacariu](mailto:victor@viprad.net).

The original concept for *SemanticPaint* was developed by a large number of people both at the University of Oxford and at Microsoft Research: Julien Valentin, Vibhav Vineet, Ming-Ming Cheng, David Kim, Shahram Izadi, Jamie Shotton, Pushmeet Kohli, Matthias Niessner, Antonio Criminisi and Philip H S Torr.

## Acknowledgements

We gratefully acknowledge the help of Julien Valentin, for his help in getting us up to speed with the project, of Victor Adrian Prisacariu and Olaf Kaehler, for implementing the 3D reconstruction engine on which our work is based, without which our work would not be possible, of Anurag Arnab, for his help with the saving and loading of scenes, and of Stephen Hicks and Joram van Rheede, for helping us to exhibit our work at SIGGRAPH 2015.

## Context

Scene understanding has many applications both within Computer Vision and beyond, but our primary motivation comes from a project led by [Stephen Hicks](http://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/stephen-hicks) to build augmented-reality glasses for the partially-sighted. Please read about it [here](http://www.va-st.com/smart-specs/).

# Installation Guide

## 1. Building the System

### 1.1 Overview

SemanticPaint builds with CMake 3.8.2 and above on Windows, Ubuntu and Mac OS X.
It has been tested on recent versions of all three operating systems, but may
require additional work to build on older versions.

### 1.2 Dependencies

SemanticPaint depends on various 3rd party libraries. Some of these are
required, in the sense that SemanticPaint will not function without them;
others are optional, but skipping them will reduce functionality.

Suitable versions of the required dependencies and some of the optional
dependencies have been included in the repository, so SemanticPaint should
build "out of the box". However, most users will probably want to install
the remaining optional libraries in order to enable full functionality.

```
  - ArrayFire (version 3.3.2)
    Status: Optional (needed for touch interaction and median filtering)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_ARRAYFIRE

  - Boost (version 1.56.0)
    Status: Required

  - CUDA (version 8.0)
    Status: Optional (needed for GPU acceleration)
    Default: Enabled
    Flag: WITH_CUDA

  - Eigen (version 3.2.2)
    Status: Required

  - GLEW (version 1.12.0)
    Status: Required on Windows/Ubuntu

  - InfiniTAM (version 3.5)
    Status: Required

  - Leap Motion SDK (version 2.2.1.24116)
    Status: Optional (needed for experimental Leap Motion support)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_LEAP

  - Oculus SDK (version 0.5.0.1)
    Status: Optional (needed for Oculus Rift support)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_OVR

  - OpenCV (version 3.1.0)
    Status: Optional (needed for feature inspection mode)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_OPENCV

  - OpenGL
    Status: Required

  - OpenMP
    Status: Optional, but recommended (needed for faster training/prediction)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_OPENMP
    Notes: Doesn't work on Mac OS X

  - OpenNI (version 2)
    Status: Optional, but recommended (needed for live reconstruction)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_OPENNI

  - SDL (version 2-2.0.7)
    Status: Required

  - Vicon SDK
    Status: Optional (needed for the Vicon tracker)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_VICON
```

### 1.3 Build Process

Common steps on all platforms:

  1. Choose a root directory, hereafter referred to as <root>.

  2. Clone the InfiniTAM repository into <root>/InfiniTAM.

  3. Build the infinitam_v3.5 branch of InfiniTAM using CMake (using <root>/InfiniTAM/InfiniTAM/build as your build directory).

  4. Clone SemanticPaint into <root>/spaint, e.g.

     ```
     $ git clone git@github.com:torrvision/spaint.git spaint
     ```

  5. Change to the spaint directory:

     ```
     $ cd spaint
     ```

#### 1.3.1 Build Process (Windows)

  1. Using a Bash shell (e.g. Git Bash, provided with msysgit), run the top-level build script, e.g. for VS2013:

     ```
     $ ./build-win.sh 12 Release
     ```

  2. Run the CMake GUI and specify <root>/spaint/build as the build directory.

  3. Enable any optional libraries you want and supply the paths.

  4. Reconfigure and regenerate the Visual Studio solution.

  5. Build with the optional libraries enabled (just run the above build command again).

#### 1.3.2 Build Process (Unix)

  1. Run the top-level build script:

     ```
     $ ./build-nix.sh "Unix Makefiles" Release
     ```

  2. Change to the build directory and run ccmake:

     ```
     $ cd build
     ```

     ```
     $ ccmake ..
     ```

  3. Enable any optional libraries you want and supply the paths.

  4. Reconfigure and regenerate the makefile.

  5. Build with the optional libraries enabled, e.g.

     ```
     $ make -j4
     ```

## 2. Running the System

The build process will build various applications, libraries and test
programs in &lt;root&gt;/build. The main application can be found at:

```
<root>/build/bin/apps/spaintgui/spaintgui
```

It can be run "out of the box" from any working directory for live
reconstruction, provided you have built with OpenNI support.

If you want to reconstruct from data stored on disk (e.g. the Teddy
sequence that is used in InfiniTAM), you can call the application
as follows:

```
$ ./spaintgui -c <path> Teddy/calib.txt -r <path> Teddy/Frames/%04i.ppm -d <path>Teddy/Frames/%04i.pgm
```

The arguments specify a text file containing calibration parameters,
and masks for the RGB and depth images in the input sequence.

Note that spaintgui also supports its own saving/loading of sequences
to/from the <root>/build/bin/apps/spaintgui/sequences subdirectory.
These can be loaded straightforwardly via:

```
$ ./spaintgui -s <sequence name>
```

## 3. Troubleshooting Tips

If you have any trouble with the build, here are some of the likely causes:

* The CMake executable is not on your path.
* The MSBuild executable is not on your path. (Windows)
* The Visual C++ compiler (cl.exe) is not on your path. (Windows)
* The latest Visual Studio updates have not been installed. (Windows)
* You're using a version of CMake that has a CUDA compilation bug (e.g. an early version of 3.11). Try CMake 3.9 instead. (Windows)
* You built Boost other than with the build script (which contains some bug fixes). Please use the build script :)
